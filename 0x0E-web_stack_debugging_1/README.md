# Web stack debugging #1

This was the second series of web stack debugging project. In this
project, I was given the task to debug webstacks in isolated containers, 
and fix the web stack to a working state.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Nginx likes port 80**
  * [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80): Bash script that
  configures Nginx to run and listen to port 80 on all of a server's active IPv4's.

* **1. Make it sweet and short**
  * [1-debugging_made_short](./1-debugging_made_short): Bash script that
  configures Nginx to listen to port 80 without running on all of a server's
  active IPv4's.
