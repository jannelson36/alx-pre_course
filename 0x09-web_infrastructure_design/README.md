# Web infrastructure design

## General
* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

This project entails my research on web infrastructure
design. Through the research on different design principles, I was able to
draw diagrams on a whiteboard of a developing web infrastructure. I begun with a
simple LAMP model and ended with a fully distributed, monitored, and secured
system.

The files in this project have links to each respective whiteboard diagram.
