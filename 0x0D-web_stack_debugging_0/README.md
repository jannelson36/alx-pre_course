# Web stack debugging #0

This was the first in a series of web stack debugging projects. For each
task, I have written a script automating the commands necessary to fix the
web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
